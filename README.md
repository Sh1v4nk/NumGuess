# NumGuess

This is a NumGuess Game that I've crafted as part of my JavaScript learning journey.

## Overview

It is a simple game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The game will tell the user if the number they guessed is too high or too low. The user has 10 chances to guess the correct number. If the user guesses the correct number within 10 chances, they win the game. If the user is unable to guess the correct number within 10 chances, they lose the game.

## How to Play

1. Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field.

2. Click on the `Submit Guess` button.

3. The game will tell you if the number you guessed is too high or too low.

4. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of chances.

5. If you guess the correct number within 10 chances, you win the game.

6. If you are unable to guess the correct number within 10 chances, you lose the game.
